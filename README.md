VacData is a node based web application. Since booking a slot for vaccination is not a cup of cake, this application makes the life easier by sending the details of vaccines and vaccincation centers. Using the CoWIN APIs, it extracts all the relevant details of the nearest vaccination centers from the CoWIN portal and emails it to the user every hour.
